[03:24] <WindowsBunny> frewsxcv: hi
[03:25] <WindowsBunny> frewsxcv: dat winapi color
[03:25] <WindowsBunny> the lonely cluster is from the nearly 400 unused -sys crates
[03:26] <WindowsBunny> frewsxcv: If all versions of a crate are yanked, can you hide it from that graph?
[03:26] <WindowsBunny> frewsxcv: If so, I'm gonna yank all the placeholders to hide them
[03:49] <frewsxcv> I ignore whether a crate is yanked. I'll publish the code now.

[07:50] <Havvy> That winapi fan is so beautiful.
[07:50] <Havvy> Amidst chaos, here's a fan.
[11:38] <booyaa_> i'll give gephi a go, i've tried and failed to get meaningful output using d3.js for anything graph related
[12:17] <badboy> I installed gephi

[12:17] <badboy> instead of the screen I put it on
[12:17] <badboy> yey java softwareâ€¦

[12:31] <badboy> Havvy: yes
[12:32] <Havvy> I'm...I'm jealous.
[12:33] <badboy> haha
[12:33] <skade> posted for the mention of the rust community
[12:35] <badboy> the Tactics & Next Steps part is not worked out all, is it?
[13:35] <skade> well, it's a draft
